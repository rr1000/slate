# Catalyze HIPPA Compliance

Learn how Catalyze not only complies with HIPPA, but builds a better, more secure environment to mitigate your risk. We did the hard work so you don't have to. In an effort to be transaparent, we go into a good amount detail on this page. As a lead in, below is a high level summary our major architecture, our guiding principles, and how it maximizes our security posture.

Need | Catalyze Approach
--------- | -----------
Encryption  | All data is encrypted in transit, end to end, and at rest. Log data is also encypted to mitigate risk of ePHI stored in log files.
Minimum Necessary Access | Access controls are always defaulted to no access unless overrided manually. 
PHI Segmentation | Using our APIs for users or clinical data, stored data is segments both logically and physically. This separates personally identifiable information (PII) and health-related information, mitigating risk of unauthorized access to ePHI. 
Monitoring | All network requests, successful and unsuccessful, are logged, along with all system logs. PHI requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) log the requestor, location, data changed/viewed. Additional, alerts are proactively sent based on suspicious activity.
Auditing | All log data is encrypted and unified, enablding secure access to full historical network activity records.
Minimum Risk to Architecture | API access is the only form of public access enabled to servers; all API access must first pass through Catalyze firewalls. To gain full access to Catalyze systems, users must login via 2 factor authentication through a bastion host, authenticate to the specific system as a regular user, and upgrade privilges on the systems termporarily as needed.
Risk Management | We proactively perform risk assessments to assure changes to our infrastructure does not expose new risks. Risks are mediated before changes are pushed to production.
Workforce Training | Despite not having access to ePHI of our customes, all Catalyze workforce members still undergo HIPAA and security training regularly.

See the details of how we comply with HIPAA below. These are mapped to specific HIPAA rules. There's a lot here but again, we are taking this on so that our customers don't have to. Controls marked with an (Req) are *Required*. Controls marked with an (A) are *Addressable*. In our environment, controls outlined below are implemented on all infrastructure that processes, stores, transmits or can otherwise gain access to ePHI (electronic protected health information). The referenced controls are listed on the left, recommendation in the middle, and Catalyze compliant implementation on the right.

# Administrative Safeguards (see [164.308](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/securityrule/adminsafeguards.pdf))

Taken directly from the wording of the Security Rule, administrative safeguards are *administrative actions, and policies and procedures, to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entityâ€™s workforce in relation to the protection of that information.*

## Security Management Process - 164.308(a)(1)(i)

```
Catalyze, Inc. has a risk management policy that defines the risk analysis and risk management process in place. Catalyze, Inc. uses NIST800-30 and 800-26 for performing risk analysis.

Policies address risk inherent within the environment and mitigating the risk to an acceptable level on par with the organizations risk posture.

Catalyze has a Sanction Policy that has sanctions for employees not adhering to certain policies.

Policies and procedures address the requirements of monitoring and logging system level events and actions taken by individuals within the environment. All requests into and out of the Catalyze network are logged, as well as all system events using Logstash. Catalyze, Inc. has implemented multiple logging and monitoring solutions to track events within their environment and to monitor for certain types of behavior.
